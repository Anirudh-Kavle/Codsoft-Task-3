## Introduction

Predicting movie genres based on text descriptions is a valuable task in the entertainment industry. This project focuses on utilizing machine learning techniques to predict movie genres from movie scripts.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is kaggle_movie_train.csv. It contains movie script data, including text descriptions and corresponding genres. The dataset is used for training and evaluating the genre prediction model.

## Usage

To run this project, you'll need to have Python and the following libraries installed:

-numpy
-pandas
-matplotlib
-seaborn
-nltk
-wordcloud
-scikit-learn


1. Download the dataset creditcard.csv and place it in the project directory.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook or Python script in your preferred development environment.
3. Run the code cells step by step to perform the following tasks:
4. Load and explore the dataset
5. Perform data preprocessing
6. Visualize the transaction class distribution
7. Analyze transaction amounts
8. Analyze transaction times
9. Train and evaluate three fraud detection models (Isolation Forest, Local Outlier Factor, SVM)
10. Examine the results, including accuracy scores and classification reports for each model.


## Results

Through our analysis and machine learning model, we have successfully predicted movie genres based on text descriptions. The Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier demonstrated a high level of accuracy in genre prediction. This model can be valuable for automated genre tagging and recommendation systems in the entertainment industry.
